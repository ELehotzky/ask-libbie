# ask-libbie
Project for CodeRED hackathon (created by Erica Lehotzky, Lou Rodriguez, and Marylene Chan)

Our objective is to create a user-friendly website to help Houston's homeless population reach the many resources available to them. From food banks and shelters to locating public restrooms, internet access, electric outlets and even supplies for those at risk of becoming homeless with pets, anyone can search our app using their zip code or current location and filter through the resources based on their needs.

We called our app "Ask Libbie" as a play on words for Lady Liberty. The Statue of Liberty represents freedom, democracy, justice, and the American Dream. It embodies the hope that all immigrants, refugees and Americans who are seeking a better life. We hope that in some small way, calling on Libbie through our app will help a local Houston in need.
